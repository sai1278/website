    Derive the rate-limit key for a request.

    Forwarded-for headers are attacker-controlled, so they are only consulted
    when an operator has declared how many reverse proxies sit in front of the
    app via ``TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT``.

    With ``TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT = 0`` (the default) the header is ignored
    entirely and the socket peer address is used.

    With ``TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT = n`` the client is the (n+1)-th entry counting
    from the *right* of ``X-Forwarded-For``. Only the rightmost n entries were
    appended by infrastructure we control; anything further left was supplied
    by the caller and can be forged. Taking the leftmost entry — the common
    mistake — lets anyone set ``X-Forwarded-For: <random>`` and get a fresh
    quota on every request.

    Reverse-proxy note: if you deploy behind one proxy (nginx, Cloudflare, an
    ALB), set TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=1 *and* make sure that proxy appends to
    X-Forwarded-For rather than replacing it. Leaving it at 0 behind a proxy is
    safe but coarse — every visitor shares the proxy's address as one bucket.
