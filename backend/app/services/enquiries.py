    Applies Vortiqen's delivery policy to an enquiry.

    The policy exists because the previous implementation returned 201 with
    "registered successfully — check your email" while Google Sheets was in
    dry-run, SMTP was unset and the webhook was empty. An enquiry that reaches
    nobody must never be reported as received.

    Policy
    ------
    development / staging
        The durable local JSONL file is an acceptable destination. Configured
        external channels are still attempted, and a failure is logged, but it
        does not fail the request — the enquiry is safe on disk.

    production
        At least one *external* channel (webhook or SMTP) must succeed, unless
        the operator has explicitly set
        ``ALLOW_LOCAL_PERSISTENCE_IN_PRODUCTION=true``. If nothing is
        configured at all, the request fails fast and loudly.
